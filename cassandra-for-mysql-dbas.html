The award itself is a goblet. The goblets are sponsored anonymously, and so thanks to the sponsor this year. Also, thanks to Colin Charles who orders and transports the goblets all the way from Malaysia for us. And now, I will hand the ceremonies over to Daniel

# Community Contributor

We have a three award recipients in the Community Contributor category. This first category specifically goes to people who have put time and effort into improving mysql for our community. Some of what I say will be direct quotes from the nominations. :)

The first winner ... For creating and maintaining ProxySQL, Rene Cannao. There is a ton of excitement around ProxySQL right now, and you've probably attended at least one talk this week which has mentioned ProxySQL, perhaps with Rene speaking. Thank you for your hard work on the product, as well as blogging and talking about ProxySQL.

The next award winner is Simon Mudd. He has "contributed massively to the quality of MySQL, finding and reporting issues, and suggesting improvements in all areas of MySQL. Through his work at booking.com, he has helped to provide a test bed platform at scale that helps to test future versions, to the benefit of all in the MySQL community. He helps to run the Madrid MySQL user group, blogs, talks at conferences, and even contributes code to the server (logging to syslog)." "He has given us a lot of feedback on upgrade/downgrade.  Balancing code cleanup and backwards compatibility is a harder problem than it sounds. We've got much better criteria now of what's OK vs not OK. Everyone that uses mysql benefits." Thank you, Simon

 The next community award winner is terribly shy and not hyperactive at all. He been a been a conference chairperson for years, ran these mysqlawards for a long time, alledgedly hates croquettes, and also has quite a few popular MySQL projects. Shlomi also would never dream of killing production servers, intentionally, in a presentation at past Percona Live's to demonstrate the functionality of Orchestrator. So, please gently thank Shlomi Noach for all his work on orchestrator and gh-ost.

# Application of the Year

The next award goes to a very widely used Application: sysbench -- a program that was stuck in 0.* version numbering schemes mostly caused by Peter Zaitsev asking for too many features which made the code unmaintainable. It recently got a lot more love and finally version 1 was released earlier this year.
This tool created a whole new style of blogging often done by competing companies in both the hard and software-spaces, where each company drives development only to be able to have their project get the highest line in a graph created by this project. I think it is fair to say that the term benchmarketing was invented by sysbench.
So a thank you to Alexey Kopytov for sysbench version 1!

Here is what some of the nominations had to say about gh-ost: "A truly innovative solution to a long-term issue within the MySQL world, developed openly, with great community excitement around it." "After all of the schema change tools that are sort of external, using relatively flaky features like triggers, a schema change tool that uses more core parts of the server (binlogging) and provides more features as a result is a pretty big step forward". 

Accepting for this project are: ___TODO___

???
It may be obvious that perhaps there is one company already particularly well represented on stage at this point. I will read one of the nominations anyway "for gh-ost, corporate sponsoring.  For a number of years now Github has been the community source repository for not only the MySQL server (and other MySQL projects), but also a huge number of community related projects, forks and branches." So, I will officially give an award to github

Accepting for github: ___TODO___(like 4 people...)

# Corporate Contributor
# of the Year
### (2)
???
Finally, the last corporate award...  "for the conference, open source tools, blog, webinar, ... AND especially for hosting two separate Percona Live events annually -- which seems to be the biggest meeting of MySQL+forks users." For many of us, the conferences are the only time we get to see each other in person. This award goes to Percona
